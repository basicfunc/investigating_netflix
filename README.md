# Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
## Description
While watching a series, I noticed that the episodes seemed to be getting shorter as I clicked on the "watch next episode" button. So, I decided to use Python and some data analysis techniques in a Jupyter notebook to investigate whether this was actually the case. Specifically, I used exploratory data analysis, a method that allows me to manipulate and analyze raw data, to create plots and draw conclusions from the data. In the end, I was able to reach a conclusion based on my analysis.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x (I used 3.10)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: pandas and matplotlib

## Analysis
Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

**Project tasks**
1. Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?

## Conclusion
"Through the completion of this project, we have gained a deeper insight into the Netflix user base and the ways in which users influence streaming platforms like Netflix. Along the way, we have also acquired the skills to conduct exploratory data analysis."
